# QWriting for Digital Assignments and Assessment

In addition to course management and blogging, QWriting can also be used to host media-rich assignments and portfolios. In this workshop, participants will learn how to scaffold digital writing assignments and projects, including using plugins and embedding rich media such as tweets, images, and video. We will also address approaches and rubrics for assessing nontraditional assignments and gesture toward a discussion of the implications and ethical considerations raised by the public-facing classroom.
