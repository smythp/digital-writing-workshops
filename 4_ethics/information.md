# Student Information: Potential Threats

Many edtech platforms, especially those used in primary schools, have been shown to leak or mismanage student data. While ideally you will not have direct control over significant student data, it pays to understand that student data can be misused in significant ways:

- Student information can be used for credible, targeted phishing attempts against students and family
- Many educational solutions aren't security conscious and can be exploited (session hijacking with unencrypted tokens is one example)
- Some primary-school edtech apps have leaked student reading levels, address, voice recordings, and even parent names
