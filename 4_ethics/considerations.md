# Considerations

## "Right to Be Forgotten"

While students may be proud (or at least accepting) of their work this year, it's possible that their blog posts may become embarrassing to them after a certain amount of time has passed. Especially if your site has been indexed by Google, a digital record of posts may also exist even after your blog has been taken down, archived, or deleted. If your blog uses or includes real names for students, posts can turn up in searches for that student's name. Since searches are now often performed on candidates seeking employment, and since some students may not have a substantial existing web presence, blog posts can occasionally appear prominently in Google results.

## Student Understanding

Many students do not fully grasp the potential implications or reputational consequences of certain kinds of public speech. Modern students are often desensitized to the risks of public speech through their use of social media, and it is difficult for many students to put themselves in the shoes of parents, potential employers, or others who may read publicly-visible posts. Students may not understand the ecosystem of the open web and may have a difficult time imagining who is likely to read their writing.

## Cultural and Situational Factors

Students can have widely varying reactions to and concerns about public writing. These reactions can include factors such as self-perception, family situation, gender roles, socioeconomic background, and immigration status, among other valid concerns.

## Online Threats

There is a kind of dysfunctional "background radiation" that comes with operating a public site on the modern internet. You may encounter spam or solicitations in the form of automated comments. It's also possible, though less likely, that our site may be specifically targeted by internet trolls or other bad actors.

## Legal Issues

FERPA (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) is a law that protects the privacy of students. Though interpretations of FERPA on the issue of public writing appear to vary, you should, at minimum, offer a way for students to easily opt out of your blog or other public-facing writing project. Other local or federal laws may also apply.
