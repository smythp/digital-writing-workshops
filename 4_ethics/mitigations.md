# Mitigations

There are a number of ways to mitigate the above concerns. Depending on your students and your circumstances, you may choose any or all of these for your course blog or other public-facing writing project:

## Communicate with Students

Discussions with students can effectively mitigate many of the above concerns, and provide an opportunity for you to educate students about concepts such as their web presence, the ins and outs of the platform being used, and the potential consequences of public writing.

## Prevent Indexing

When creating a blog on Qwriting, you have the option to prevent Google from indexing the site for search results. This makes it more difficult to find the site on the web and prevents records of posts from persisting after they have been deleted or made private.

## Use Aliases

Aliases or nicknames allow students to post without using their real names. You can present this as an option to students, require that all students choose aliases, or assign aliases to each student yourself. Each approach has its own considerationsâ€”students sometimes choose inappropriate aliases, for example, and there are situations in which it can be advantageous for student posts to be associated with their name.

## Make Qwriting posts private

If a student does not want their posts to be public, they can choose to put a password on the post or require that users be signed in to see it. These options can be accessed in the `Visibility` section under the publishing options when creating a post.

## Keep Up-To-Date

If using your own self-hosted blog instead of a platform such as Qwriting, make sure to keep the installation up-to-date to prevent spam, hacking, and loss of functionality.
