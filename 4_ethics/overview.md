# Ethics and the Technology-Assisted Classroom

This workshop will consider how teaching changes when students are encouraged to produce work that lives online.  For instance, what are our ethical and legal responsibilities to protect students’ identities? How does a course change when students discuss course issues not only in class, but throughout the week? What do teachers need to know about privacy (their own and that of their students)? When, if ever, is it important to “unplug” a classroom? We will discuss a range of issues, guided by our participants’ concerns and focused on the ethics of the 21st-century classroom.
