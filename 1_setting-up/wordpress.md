# What's WordPress?

WordPress is software that runs on a serverâ€”basically, a computer that is connected to the internet all the time. WordPress originally allowed users to easily set up a personal blog, and provided a user-friendly way to add content as well as the design of the site. These days, WordPress is used as a content management system (CMS) for many kinds of sites, not just blogs.

There are two main ways to use WordPress: via self-hosting or through wordpress.net. Wordpress.net is a site that you sign up for, like Facebook or Twitter, and it allows you to manage your blog without worrying about hosting. You have to pay a fee for certain kinds of use, and your ability to add new functionality to the site is limited. The self-hosted version of WordPress is free to use, but you need to pay for a server to host it. It's less restricted, and you can do anything you want with the site, including adding plugins that provide additional functionality.
