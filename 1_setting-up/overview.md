Setting Up Your Technology-Assisted Classroom 

This workshop introduces participates to the technology-assisted classroom, an environment in which approaches to digital communication such as social media and blogging serve traditional student-oriented pedagogical goals. Participants will learn to set up a class site using QWriting—an open-source WordPress-based blogging platform—and will learn best practices for engaging students through low-stakes writing and peer response. This workshop will also survey other frequently-used tools in digital pedagogy, such as wikis and platforms for real-time collaboration.
