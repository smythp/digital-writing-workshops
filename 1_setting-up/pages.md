# Adding Pages

Typically, you'll want to add a few static pages, such as a course description page or a syllabus page. To add new pages to the site, follow these steps:

1. In the dashboard, click the `Pages` button in the gray bar on the left.
2. Click the `Add New` button next to the heading that says "Pages.
3. Add a title and some content, then click `Publish`.
4. Hover over `Appearance` on the gray left menu bar in the dashboard, then select `Menus`.
5. Under `Menu Shortcuts`, you should see the pages that are currently appearing on your site. If your new page isn't there, check it in the left panel and click `Add to Menu`. You can drag and drop the items in the right panel to change the order they will appear in the menu. When you're satisfied with the items in your menu, click the blue `Save Menu` button in the botton right.
6. Check the front page of your site to make sure the menu is appearing correctly. You can view the public-facing portion of your site by clicking the site name in the gray bar on the top left of the dashboard.
