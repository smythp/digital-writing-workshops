## Why Digital Writing Pedagogy?

As teachers of composition and rhetoric, we're concerned not only with our students' formal writing ability, but also with their capacity to think critically and argue persuasively. Increasingly, however, our students are already fighting on a number of rhetorical fronts, engagements that play out on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, MMS, blogs, wikis, and search.

Digital writing pedagogy is not about teaching specific platforms or technology. Instead, it seeks to expand the core considerations of the writing classroom to a new age of ubiquitous digital rhetoric. Digital writing pedagogy is both practical and idealistic. It acknowledges the lived experience and expertise of students while contending that the core skills of analysis and writing are even more critical in this new rhetorical milieu.

This workshop series is positioned as an introduction to digital writing pedagogy. It combines the practical—"How do I set up a course blog?"—with the theoretical—"How can my students apply core intro comp principles on digital platforms?" The next section will discuss some of the recurring considerations and concerns of digital writing pedagogy, many of which we will be returning to again and again in this workshop series.
