### Adding Users

For a course blog, you will need to add your students as users before they can access the dashboard to create new posts.

1. Have your students [sign up for QWriting](http://social.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/register/) and then email you either their QWriting username or their Queens College email address.
2. To add a new student, click `Users` in the gray bar on the left. On the Users page, click `Add New`.
3. Enter the student's email or QWriting usernamein the box labelled `Email or Username`.
4. Choose a role for the student. Typically this will be `Author` or `Contributor`.
5. Check the box that says `Add the user without sending an email that requires their confirmation` to allow your student to skip that step. Otherwise they will be sent an email containing a URL that they will need to click to be confirmed on the site.
6. Click the blue `Add Existing User` button below the input field.

After the page refreshes, you should see a short message saying that the user has been added successfully. If you receive a message saying that the user does not exist, reach out to the student to make sure that they created their QWriting account and confirmed their email address.
