## Introducing Qwriting

[QWriting](http://qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/) is a large, multiblog installation of WordPress hosted by the [Writing at Queens program](http://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/supportprograms/waq/Pages/default.aspx). Like wordpress.net, you can use it to sign up for a blog that is hosted at the college. When you use QWriting, you don't have to worry about hosting or servers. However, like wordpress.net, you will be limited to themes and plugins that have been installed on the QWriting platform.

### Getting Started with QWriting

1. [Sign up for a QWriting account](http://social.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/register/). You will need to use your Queens email account during the signup process. You have the option to create your own blog at this stageâ€”go ahead and check the box to create your own blog.
2. To access the blog that was created for you during the signup process, first [sign in to QWriting](http://qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/wp-login.php). Once you're signed in, hover over the `My Sites` button on the top left of the page in the gray toolbar. You should see the site that was created for you in the dropdown.
3. If you didn't check the box to automatically create a new site or need to create a site in an account that already exists, go [here](http://qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/wp-signup.php) to generate a new site. The site domain is the address (URL) of the site, while the title is human-readable and will appear at the top of your site. The domain should not have spaces, while the site title can have spaces.
