# Best Strategies for Online Discussion, Annotation, and Collaborative Work

This workshop helps participants to build an online community in which their students can have substantive discussion and conduct meaningful remote work. This involves setting up parameters and goals for discussion, as well as fostering student buy-in to the possibility of meaningful online discourse. We will also tackle the issue of how to structure collaborative online assignments using Google Docs, QWriting, and other platforms. Furthermore, we will discuss the most effective ways for teachers to draw this remote work into class discussion and assess this online work. Finally, we will consider the ways in which these strategies can be used in the flipped classroom as part of a larger discussion of what the flipped classroom is all about.
