To begin *** Get everyone logged into the blog. Blog address: http://digitalwritingworkshopwaqspring2017.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/blog/

Agenda: 
What are five goals (either general or course specific) you have for your students with regard to their use of digital writing?
Participants do a 3-5 minute written response to this question
Participants share with the person next to them
Facilitator elicits feedback from the group

Practice: 
Comment Press with an article 
Read Bruni article posted under “Today’s Reading” 
Try to figure out how to make comments on it 
Comment on the blog (under special pages-->blog)
Student response saved in draft folder on blog--publish in real time so they can discuss 
Ask them all to record a response on paper
Then have them take turns commenting on the blog
Discuss how the hierarchy of comments changes the way the discussion works-- does asynchronic discussion change things? 

Discussion: How does commentpress differ from commenting via the blog? What are the different strengths? What might be the different uses of it? Why might you choose this over that? How is (or is) annotation different than discussion? 

Response: 3-5 mins how could you see yourself using this in your class 

 Discussion: Strengths of this format--
Discursive community
Real time feedback/dialogue
Discussion archives
Student accountability
